Use more processes per socket:
mpirun -v -np 2 -npersocket 2 python run_simulation.py

Run on people but always keep rank == 1 free for receiving (even if not needed here);
otherwise keep the last processor free and use R processors, R is the rank (or Ncpu - 1);

what I ran (but it's silly since I can use only one processor (rank = [0, 1]),
and need to keep rank = 1 free for recv:

        rank_dict = {
            0: infected_r[0:int(len(infected_r) / 2)],
            0: infected_r[int(len(infected_r) / 2):]
        }
        for rank_val, peep_list in rank_dict.items():
            for persons in peep_list:
                for person in persons:
                    comm.send(person.health_information,
                              dest=rank_val, tag=rank_val)
